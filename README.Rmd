The goal of flexdashboard is to make it easy to create interactive dashboards for R, using R Markdown.

* Use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

* Support for a wide variety of components including [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org); base, lattice, and grid graphics; tabular data; gauges and value boxes; and text annotations.

* Flexible and easy to specify row and column-based [layouts](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/layouts.html). Components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices.

* [Storyboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/using.html#storyboards-1) layouts for presenting sequences of visualizations and related commentary.

* Optionally use [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) to drive visualizations dynamically.

* Optionally use [bslib](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/) to easily [customize main colors and fonts](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/theme.html).

## Installation

Install the **flexdashboard** package from CRAN as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flexdashboard")
```

If you want to use the development version of the flexdashboard package, you can install the package from GitHub via the [**remotes** package](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

```r
remotes::install_github('rstudio/flexdashboard')
```
## Usage

To author a flexdashboard you create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document with the `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` output format. You can do this from within RStudio using the **New R Markdown** dialog:

![](man/figures/NewRMarkdown.png)

If you are not using RStudio, you can create a new `flexdashboard` R Markdown file from the R console. Currently there are two `templates`: 

+ `"flex_dashboard"` (basic) and 

+ `"flex_dashboard_bslib"` (an example of [theming with `{bslib}`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/reference/articles/articles/theme.html)):

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("dashboard.Rmd", 
                 template = "flex_dashboard_bslib", 
                 package = "flexdashboard")
```

## Getting help

There are two main places to get help with flexdashboard:

+ The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/tags/c/R-Markdown/10/flexdashboard) is a friendly place to ask any questions about flexdashboard. Be sure to use the `flexdashboard` tag. Add also the `shiny` tag is you are using a Shiny runtime.

+ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flexdashboard) is a great source of answers to common flexdashboard questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem. Use the tags [`[r][flexdashboard]`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flexdashboard+r) if you ask a question. Add the tag `[shiny]` if you are using a Shinyy runtime.
