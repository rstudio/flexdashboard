\arguments{
\item{fig_width}{Default width (in inches) for figures}

\item{fig_height}{Default height (in inches) for figures}

\item{fig_retina}{Scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2).
Note that for flexdashboard enabling retina scaling provides for both
crisper graphics on retina screens but also much higher quality
auto-scaling of R graphics within flexdashboard containers.}

\item{fig_mobile}{Create an additional rendering of each R graphics figure
optimized for rendering on mobile devices oriented in portrait mode.
If \code{TRUE}, creates a figure which is 3.75 x 4.80 inches wide;
if \code{FALSE}, create no additional figure for mobile devices;
if a numeric vector of length 2, creates a mobile figure with the
specified width and height.}

\item{dev}{Graphics device to use for figure output (defaults to png)}

\item{smart}{Produce typographically correct output, converting straight
quotes to curly quotes, \code{---} to em-dashes, \code{--} to en-dashes, and
\code{...} to ellipses.}

\item{self_contained}{Produce a standalone HTML file with no external
dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked
scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. Note that even for self contained
documents MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of
its size).}

\item{favicon}{Path to graphic to be used as a favicon for the dashboard.
Pass \code{NULL} to use no favicon.}

\item{logo}{Path to graphic to be used as a logo for the dashboard. Pass
\code{NULL} to not include a logo. Note
that no scaling is performed on the logo image, so it should fit exactly
within the dimensions of the navigation bar (48 pixels high for the
default "cosmo" theme, other themes may have slightly different navigation
bar heights).}

\item{social}{Specify a character vector of social sharing services to
automatically add sharing links for them on the \code{navbar}. Valid values
are "twitter", "facebook", "google-plus", "linkedin", and "pinterest" (more
than one service can be specified).}

\item{source_code}{URL for source code of dashboard (used primarily for
publishing flexdashboard examples). Automatically creates a \code{navbar}
item which links to the source code.}

\item{navbar}{Optional list of elements to be placed on the flexdashboard
navigation bar. Each element should be a list containing a \code{title}
and/or \code{icon} field, an \code{href} field. Optional fields \code{target}
(e.g. "_blank") and \code{align} ("left" or "right") are also supported.}

\item{orientation}{Determines whether level 2 headings are treated as
dashboard rows or dashboard columns.}

\item{vertical_layout}{Vertical layout behavior: "fill" to vertically resize
charts so they completely fill the page; "scroll" to layout charts at their
natural height, scrolling the page if necessary.}

\item{storyboard}{\code{TRUE} to use a storyboard layout scheme that places
each dashboard component in a navigable storyboard frame. When a
storyboard layout is used the \code{orientation} and \code{vertical_layout}
arguments are ignored. When creating a dashbaord with multiple pages you
should apply the `{.storyboard}` attribute to individual pages rather
than using the global \code{storyboard} option.}

\item{theme}{Visual theme ("default", "bootstrap", "cerulean", "journal",
"flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", "cosmo", "lumen", "paper",
"sandstone", "simplex", or "yeti"). The "cosmo" theme is used when "default"
is specified.}

\item{highlight}{Syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include
"default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn",
and "haddock". Pass NULL to prevent syntax highlighting.}

\item{mathjax}{Include mathjax. The "default" option uses an https URL from a
MathJax CDN. The "local" option uses a local version of MathJax (which is
copied into the output directory). You can pass an alternate URL or pass
\code{NULL} to exclude MathJax entirely.}

\item{extra_dependencies}{Additional function arguments to pass to the
base R Markdown HTML output formatter \code{\link[rmarkdown]{html_document_base}}}

\item{css}{One or more css files to include}

\item{includes}{Named list of additional content to include within the
document (typically created using the \code{\link[rmarkdown]{includes}} function).}

\item{lib_dir}{Directory to copy dependent HTML libraries (e.g. jquery,
bootstrap, etc.) into. By default this will be the name of the document with
\code{_files} appended to it.}

\item{md_extensions}{Markdown extensions to be added or removed from the
default definition or R Markdown. See the \code{\link[rmarkdown]{rmarkdown_format}} for
additional details.}

\item{pandoc_args}{Additional command line options to pass to pandoc}

\item{devel}{Enable development mode (used for development of the format
itself, not useful for users of the format).}

\item{resize_reload}{Disable the auto-reloading behavior when the window is resized.
Useful when debugging large flexdashboard applications and this functionality
is not needed.}

\item{...}{Unused}
