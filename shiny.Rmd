## Overview

By adding [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to a flexdashboard, you can create dashboards that enable viewers to change underlying parameters and see the results immediately, or that update themselves incrementally as their underlying data changes (see [`reactiveFileReader`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/reactiveFileReader.html) and [`reactivePoll`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/reactivePoll.html)). This is done by adding `runtime: shiny` to a standard flexdashboard and then adding one or more input controls and/or reactive expressions that dynamically drive the appearance of the charts within the dashboard.

Using Shiny with flexdashboard turns a static R Markdown report into an [Interative Document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html). It's important to note that interactive documents need to be [deployed](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html#deployment) to a Shiny Server to be shared broadly (whereas static R Markdown documents are standalone web pages that can be attached to emails or served from any standard web server).

Note that the [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) package provides another way to create dashboards with Shiny.  

## Requirements

The steps required to add Shiny components to a flexdashboard are as follows:

1. Add `runtime: shiny` to the options declared at the top of the document (YAML front matter).

2. Add the `{.sidebar}` attribute to the first column of the dashboard to make it a host for Shiny input controls (note this step isn't strictly required, but most Shiny based dashboards will want to do this).

3. Add Shiny inputs and output as appropriate.

4. When including plots, be sure to wrap them in a call to [renderPlot](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/renderPlot.html)). This is important not only for dynamically responding to changes but also to ensure that they are automatically re-sized when their container changes.

A simple example of a Shiny based flexdashboard is provided below.

## Simple Example

The following example demonstrates the basics of using Shiny within a flexdashboard:

#### Source Code

Here's the source code for the example:

<div id="shiny"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('shiny')</script>

The first column ("Inputs") includes the `{.sidebar}` attribute and the Shiny input controls; the second column ("Outputs") includes the Shiny code required to render the chart based on the inputs.

## Input Sidebar

The `{.sidebar}` attribute is a special designator indicating that a column should be laid out flush to the left with a fixed width of 250 pixels and a special background color. Sidebars are not required for flexdashboards using `runtime: shiny`, but they are often useful for presenting inputs.

Sidebars always appear on the left no matter where they are defined within the flow of the document. You can alter the default width of the sidebar using the `data-width` attribute. For example:

<div id="sidebarwidth"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('sidebarwidth')</script>

### Global Sidebar

If you are creating a flexdashboard with [Multiple Pages](using.html#multiple-pages) you may want to use a single sidebar that applies across all pages. In this case you should use the `{.sidebar-global}` attribute (rather than the `{.sidebar}` attribute). 

For example, this dashboard includes a sidebar on the first page with the `{.sidebar-global}` attribute which results in the sidebar being visible for both pages:

<div id="sidebarmultiplepages"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('sidebarmultiplepages')</script>
