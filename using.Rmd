## Layout Orientation

### Columns

By default, level 2 markdown headers (`------------------`) within dashboards define columns, with individual charts stacked vertically within each column. Here's the definition of a two column dashboard with one chart on the left and two on the right:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">
<div id="columnorientation"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('columnorientation')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 nopadding">
<div height="422px" width="100%">
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px422?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px211?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px211?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

### Rows

You can also choose to orient dashboards row-wise rather than column-wise, by specifying the `orientation: rows` option. For example, this layout defines two rows, the first of which has a single chart and the second of which has two charts:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">
<div id="roworientation"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('roworientation')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 nopadding">
<div height="454px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px227?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<div>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px227?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px227?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

## Page Fill vs. Scrolling

By default flexdashboard charts are laid out to automatically fill the height of the browser. This works well for a small number of vertically stacked charts, however if you have lots of charts you'll probably want to scroll rather than fit them all onto the page. You can control this behavior using the `vertical_layout` option. Specify `fill` to vertically resize charts so they completely fill the page and `scroll` to layout charts at their natural height, scrolling the page if necessary.

For example, the following layout includes 3 charts and requests that the page scroll as necessary to accomodate their natural height:

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">
<div id="chartstack-scrolling"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('chartstack-scrolling')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 nopadding">
<div height="406px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px135?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px135?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px135?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>

</div>

## Chart Sizing

To create an ideal layout for your dashboard, it's important to understand how the size of individual charts is determined. This section describes the layout algorithm and the various ways you can tweak its behavior.

### Chart Width

The width of charts in flexdashboard is ultimately determined by the width of the browser. If your layout has a single column then charts will occupy the full width of the browser. If your layout has multiple columns then the columns will split the available width evenly (unless overridden via the `data-width` attribute as described below).

### Chart Height

The height of charts is determined in one of two ways depending on whether your dashboard is configured to fit itself into the vertical confines of the page (`vertical_layout: fill`) or to scroll (`vertical_layout: scroll`):

1. For dashboards that fill the page the height of charts will be determined by the height of the browser, with vertically stacked charts splitting the available height evenly (unless overridden via the `data-height` attribute as described below).

2. For scrolling dashboards, the height of charts will be determined by the knitr `fig.height` option, which defaults to 4 inches (384 pixels).

### Size Attributes

The nature of the charts within your dashboard (desired emphasis, visualization types, etc.) will often dictate that you'll want to change the default sizing behavior. If no size attributes are specified then the relative size of each chart will be determined by it's knitr figure size (this is 5x4 inches or 480x384 pixels by default).

You can modify the default sizing behavior by applying the `data-width` and `data-height` attributes to rows, columns, or even individual charts. These attributes establish the relative size between charts laid out in the same dimension (horizontal or vertical).

### Examples

This example use the `data-height` attribute to dictate a larger vertical size for the first row, resulting in a layout that more clearly emphasizes the first chart.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<div id="chartsizing"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('chartsizing')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 nopadding">
<div height="454px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px286?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<div>
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px168?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 50%;">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px168?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>


This example is a variation of the single-column layout demonstrated above with a `data-height` attribute applied to the first chart:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<div id="chartdataheight"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('chartdataheight')</script>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6 nopadding">
<div height="360px" width="100%">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px173?size=28&amp;text=Chart 1">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px100?size=28&amp;text=Chart 2">
<img class="holder" src="holder.js/100px100?size=28&amp;text=Chart 3">
</div>
</div>

</div>

Note that in this case we've only applied the `data-height` attribute to the first chart. The other charts size will be derived from their knitr figure height (by default 384 pixels). You can of course explicitly specify a `data-height` for each chart if you wish.

### Flexible Boxes

Layout is done using the browser [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) engine, which alters its items' width and/or height to best fill the available space on any display device. A flexbox layout expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

The implication of this is that chart dimensions established via either knitr figure sizes or `data-width` and `data-height` attributes are used to establish relative sizes between charts within the same horizontal or vertical dimension as opposed to absolute sizes (this corresponds to the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` CSS properties).


## Figure Sizes and Scaling

Charts will always be automatically scaled to fit within their allocated flexbox region. Charts based on [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) can dynamically resize themselves, so their scaling will nearly always result in charts that perfectly fit the bounds of their containers.

It's also possible to use charts created using standard R graphics (base, lattice, ggplot2, etc.) with flexdashboard. Within dynamic (Shiny) dashboards these charts are also automatically sized to fit within their containers so long as they are wrapped within a call to [renderPlot](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/renderPlot.html).

Within static dashboards standard R graphics are also scaled (with aspect ratios preserved so there is no stretching or distortion). However, since these charts are PNG images it's not possible for them to seamlessly fill the bounds of their container. When creating static dashboards containing standard R graphics it's therefore critical to define knitr `fig.width` and `fig.height` values as close as possible to what they'll actually be on the page.

Here's an example of a row based layout that includes 3 charts from R base graphics:

<div id="figuresizes"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('figuresizes')</script>


We've specified an explicit `fig.height` and `fig.width` for each chart so that their rendered size fits their flex container as closely as possible. Note that the ideal values for these dimensions typically need to be determined by experimentation. Note also that we are using a scrolling layout (`vertical_layout: scroll`) which makes it easier to reason about the actual height which plots will be rendered at.

Even with the tweaks described above standard R graphics won't always fit perfectly into their containers, so in general htmlwidget based charts are preferred within static dashboards. Note that the [plotly](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/) package enables rendering of ggplot2 graphics as interactive htmlwidgets.

## Multiple Pages

If you have more than a handful of charts you'd like to include in a dashboard, you may want to consider dividing the dashboard into multiple pages. To define a page just use a level 1 markdown header (`==================`). Each page you define will have its own top-level navigation tab.

For example, this code creates a dashboard with two pages, each containing two charts:

<div id="multiplepages"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('multiplepages')</script>

Note that in this example both pages use the default "columns" orientation. It is however possible to specify a distinct orientation for an individual page. This is done by adding the `data-orientation` attribute to the header of the page you want to change the orientation of. For example:

<div id="pageorientation"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('pageorientation')</script>

## Navigation Bar

By default, the flexdashboard navigation bar includes only the dashboard title. When a dashboard has [Multiple Pages], links to other available pages are also included on the left. You can also add custom links to navigation bar using the `navbar` option. For example, the following adds an "About" link to the left side of the navigation bar and a Source Code link to the right side of the navigation bar:

<div id="navbarlinks"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('navbarlinks')</script>

Navigation bar items must include either a `title` or `icon` field (both can also be specified as the "Source Code" item demonstrates). You should also include a `url` as the navigation target. The `align` field is optional (it can be "left" or "right" and defaults to "right").

### Icon Sets

You can specify icons for navigation bar items from three differnet icon sets:

1. [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/)

2. [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)

3. [Bootstrap Glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)

When referring to an icon you should use it's full name including the icon set prefix (e.g. "fa-github", "ion-social-twitter", "glyphicon-time", etc.). Note also that if you don't provide a `url` for social sharing icons (e.g. "fa-twitter" or "fa-facebook") then one will be provided automatically (this works for icons associated with Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, LinkedIn, and Pinterest).

### Social/Code Links

You can include links to social sharing services or a link to the dashboard's source code via the `social` and `source_code` options. For example, the following dashboard includes Twitter and Facebook links as well as a source code link:

<div id="navbarautolinks"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('navbarautolinks')</script>

The `social` option can include any number of the following services: "facebook", "twitter", "google-plus", "linkedin", and "pinterest".

## Text Annotations

If you need to include additional content (an introduction or explanation, links to related material, etc.) within your dashboard you can do so in several ways:

1. You can include content at the top of the page before dashboard sections are introduced.

2. You can define dashboard sections that don't include a chart but rather include arbitrary content (text, images, equations, etc.)

3. You can provide short text annotations for the various charts within a dashboard by including text immediately below the R code chunk where the chart is rendered.

For example, the following dashboard includes some content at the top, brief footer comments for each chart, and a dashboard section that contains only text.

<div id="textannotation"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('textannotation')</script>

This example also demonstrates the use of a "setup chunk" to load required R packages prior to executing the rest of the R chunks that make use of them, as well as using a custom `data-height` attribute for the rows to make the first row disproportionately larger than the second row.

## Visual Themes

A variety of themes are available to modify the appearance of flexdashboard. Supported themes include "default", "bootstrap", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", "cosmo", "lumen", "paper", "sandstone", "simplex", and "yeti". Note that the "cosmo" theme is used when "default" is specified.

These themes are all based on the themes available in the [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) package (which are in turn based on [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes).

Use the `theme` option to specify an alternate theme:

<div id="themes"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">loadSnippet('themes')</script>
